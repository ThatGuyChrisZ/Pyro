        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>The goal of our project is to produce a cost-effective, autonomous drone system capable of generating highly accurate, real-time 2D heat maps of active wildfires. Our approach centers around two main elements: a ground control system and a semi-autonomous drone. The drone is responsible for data collection using a variety of sensors: a thermal camera, GPS, dual-redundant IMU, and an altimeter. It is custom-designed and 3D-printed using a carbon nylon frame with an emphasis on maintaining a light weight alongside the necessary power management dependencies. On board the drone is a variety of system hardware components including a Pixhawk flight controller, an electronic speed controller, and a ride-along Raspberry Pi board that is utilized along with a telemetry radio to communicate with the ground control station.</p>

        <p>The ground control system is responsible for both flight control and data analysis. Radio communication will be utilized to both communicate flight commands and transmit collected data from the ride-along board. The Ardupilot program on the ground control computer communicates with the on board flight controller to maintain the proper flight path and ensure motors, propellers, and the speed controller are functioning as intended. Data collected by the drone will be serialized and delivered as packets to the ground control computer. Once received, data packets are decoded and permanently stored in an SQLite database. The database is then visualized as a heat map overlay using the Javascript Leaflet library and OpenStreetMap. </p>
        <p>The primary intended users for this project are emergency management and fire departments. Our aim is to improve upon their current wildfire tracking solutions, like satellite imaging, by producing high-resolution wildfire heatmaps in real time. Users could also include residents who seek accurate, timely data in these emergency situations. With emergency management technology, dependability is essential. We will seek to maintain reliability through accurate data collection, data transmission checks and post-processing correction. Making certain that only reliable data is used for analysis and visualization will also ensure that safety and security are achieved. </p>

        <p>This 2019 paper from an IEEE Conference outlines a proposed drone-based system for wildfire monitoring that particularly targets remote areas. A key feature of their approach is a distributed leader-follower model where drones form clusters to maximize the collective field coverage. With the primary objectives of their system being maximizing the coverage area using a minimum number of drones and limiting energy consumption.</p>

        <p>This 2021 paper from a group of students at Chongqing University details a strategic deployment model to optimize the number and positions of drones for full wildfire coverage. An integral focus of their model is maintaining flexibility and adaptivity to unique terrains and the expansion of the wildfire area. Using wildfire timing data from an Australian fire of the previous year, they concluded their system would pose a benefit as a novel wildfire rapid response system.</p>
